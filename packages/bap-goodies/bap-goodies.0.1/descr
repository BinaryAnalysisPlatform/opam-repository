A collection of Emacs modes for work with BAP

bap-mode
Emacs major mode for reading and analyzing programs in BAP's IR.
It allows to interact with BAP from within emacs. For example, bap-open-file (C-c C-b o) opens
a file with BAP and emits the IR to an Emacs buffer. bap-mode hightlights the syntax and allows
to quickly navigate the code (e.g. C-c C-b m to jump to the main function).
