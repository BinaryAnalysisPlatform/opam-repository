Open Generic Representation library

OGRE is a self-describing data storage. It is open for
extensibility, i.e., adding new types of knowledge doesn't break
the storage. It also has a well-specified open representation, so
that any tool written in any language (or even a human itself) can
create, modify and understand the contents (like XML). Ogre
provides data persitance and, more importantly, a type safe way of
querying and updating the data. The query language is rich enough,
and supports joins and boolean constraints
